Still after the first adjustments made, it looks like I am still addressing such issue directly, which goes out of the purposes of my thesis.  \n",

Although, some of the papers I have read point out the fact that Humanities researches are mostly published on Books, still it is a difficult type of resource to analyse considering it's less availability.  \n",
