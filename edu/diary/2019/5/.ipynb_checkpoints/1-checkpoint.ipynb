Our system should be able to do a regex filter tool, along with a standard regex interface for non regex expert users. For our next meeting I will work on building a workflow which can do a Topic-model process and generate results which could be saved. "

    "## DIPAM adjustments and new Features\n",
    "These are all things I have fixed in DIPAM according to the feedbacks received on the last CATARSI meeting:\n",
    "* **Add ‘Undo’ ‘Redo’ buttons**: this feature is available when adding or removing elements from the graph\n",
    "* **Processing order of the nodes** The definition of the path is also something known as ’Topological Sort’ (https://www.techiedelight.com/topological-sorting-dag/) \n",
    "* **Handling the visual addition of the nodes**: When adding a node it will appear under the others add just before him (in case there is another node there already) \n",
    "* **Add the zoom buttons (+ -)**: these icons have been added into the graph so it shows that it’s possible to zoom in/out\n",
    "* **Once someone adds a node the edit section of it will open**\n",
    "* **The graph will check if there is any situation of Loop (as I described in the previous diary report)** \n",
    "* **DIPAM works also in Firefox (along with Chrome), it still got a small issue regarding the zoom in/out actions**\n",

    "I have started integrating Flask into DIPAM. Right now the first steps I would like to handle are the saving/loading of configuration and workflow JSON files. "
