    "## The EURAM 2019 Conference\n",
    "Together with Luca Pareschi and Paolo Ferri we went to Lisbon to attend the EURAM 2019 Conference. We have organised a Symposia and presented [MITAO, A Mashup Interface for Text Analysis Operations](https://github.com/catarsi/mitao). The audience was acknowledged 2 days before starting this session on how the tool could be installed on their local machines. The presentation was very successful, and we received a lot of positive feedbacks from the audience, which found our work highly interesting and applicable in their own research. "
