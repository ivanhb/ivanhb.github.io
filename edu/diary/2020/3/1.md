## Retraction analysis: things to keep in mind
Other examples to enforce the question: “How much is important and influential to have a background on the cited article to correctly annotate the in-text citations?”

Example(1):  
> “We thought there were research articles that should never be pub- lished because they were of poor quality and would do more harm than good. The study that falsely attrib- uted autism to childhood vaccinations and was later retracted is an example.8,9 Consequently, we previ- ously favored a “three rejection strikes and you are out” approach, relegating manuscripts with invalid results to the Journal of Improbable Research10 or the Journal of Universal Rejection.11"

Example(2):  
>“Additionally, 17% of par- ents refused all vaccines, and in a 2009 survey, 11.5% of parents of children age 17 and younger reported refusing at least one vaccine.3 immunization refusal is often due to misinformation perpetuated by the antivaccination movement that includes some well-known celebrities who claim that vaccines cause autism despite the fact that the pivotal British study from which they base their arguments was widely discredited and retracted.4 Unfortunately, this move- ment continues to make inroads, and there are a growing number of par- ents who seek nonmedical (personal or religious) exemptions from vacci- nations for their children to attend public schools. "

##Retraction analysis: “Qualifies" vs “Credits”
After modifying the annotation model through the assignment of inner priorities to each singular Object Property of CiTo, I wanted to make one last check especially for the cases having the **citation_intent = qualifies or credits.**

##Finalise the MITAO PIJ paper
I have finalised the technical parts of the MITAO paper and made a final revision of the paper. After finishing writing his parts of the paper, Luca submitted the paper. 

##Retraction paper: the methodology
Together with Silvio we decided to publish the adopted methodology for generating the in-text citations into as a separated document using the Protocols.io service ([https://www.protocols.io/](https://www.protocols.io/)).  
Before moving to Protocols.io, I decided to create a step-by-step python notebook (and python) guideline to follow along with the methodology steps, in order to make the steps easier to comprehend and execute. You can see it at here: [github.com/ivanhb/phd/.../method_dataset.ipynb](https://github.com/ivanhb/phd/blob/master/project/retraction_analysis/wakefield_retraction/method/method_dataset.ipynb).
I have started writing the methodology using Protocols.io, I suppose it will take at least 2 days for finishing it.
