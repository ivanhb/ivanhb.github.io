The main idea is to combine citations quantitative studies with the “citation function” characterisation, and try to infer relevant information, e.g. how is the authority of a particular author is changing over the time, and what did actually happen to him after such turning point.</div><div>A good example is the “Vax” controversial article, which has been retracted at some point, but still other works keep citing it.

Here I would like to write down some important notes I got from it.</span></div><ul><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">An overview and the objectives:</span></div><div>This study examined the impact of retracted articles on biomedical communication. This work is based on MEDLINE from 1966 through August 1997 for articles that had been retracted. The main objective is to examine publications identified in the biomedical literature as having been retracted, to ascertain why and by whom the publications were retracted and to what extent citations of later-retracted articles continue to be incor- porated in subsequent work.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Measures and results:</span></div><div>The main measure taken in consideration is regarding the characteristics of retractions and citations to articles after retraction. The results of this work are based on a total of 235 articles had been retracted. Error was acknowledged in relation to 91 articles; results could not be replicated in 38; misconduct was evi- dent in 86; and no clear reason was given in 20. Of the 235 articles, 190 were re- tracted by some or all of the authors; 45 were retracted by a person or organization other than the author(s). The 235 retracted articles were cited 2034 times after the retraction notice. Examination of 299 of those citations reveals that in only 19 in- stances was the retraction noted; the remaining 280 citations treated the retracted article either explicitly (n = 17) or implicitly (n = 263) as though it were valid research.</div></li><li><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Work conclusions:</span></div><div>Retracted articles continue to be cited as valid work in the biomedical literature after publication of the retraction; these citations signal potential problems for biomedical science.</div></li></ul><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-size: 18px;">Post retraction citations in context: a case study [2]</span></div><ul><li><div><font style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">An overview:</span></font></div><div>"This study examines the nature of citations to articles that were retracted in 2014.
