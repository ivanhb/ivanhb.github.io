After my high school graduation at the age of 18, I moved to the <a href='http://www.unibo.it/en'>University of Bologna</a> (Italy) where I have studied and completed my bachelor and master degree in Computer Science. After my graduation, I worked for a year as a research fellow at the <a href='http://opencitations.net/'>OpenCitations organization</a> (directed by <a href='https://essepuntato.it'>Silvio Peroni</a> and <a href='https://twitter.com/dshotton'>David Shotton</a>).</p><p>I'm currently on my last Ph.D. year at the <a href='http://www.ficlit.unibo.it/'>Department of Classical Philology and Italian Studies</a>, <a href='http://www.unibo.it/en'>University of Bologna</a>. My Ph.D. studies concern the integration of the Semantic Web technologies in the Science Of Science (SoS) field of study, especially toward the Arts and Humanities domain. My focus is toward the understanding of the retraction phenomenon in the scientific publication with the application of a qualitative and quantitative analysis on the bibliographic and citation data.</p><p>Among my research interests are Semantic Web technologies, Information science, and Data visualisation. In particular, my recent works concern the understanding of scholarly citations, bibliometrics and scientometrics studies, visualisation and browsing interfaces for semantic data, and developing user-friendly applications for scientists lacking computer programming skills.</p>",
