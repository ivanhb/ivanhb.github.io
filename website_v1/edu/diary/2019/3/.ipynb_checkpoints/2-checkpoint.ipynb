    "We will send this document when re-submitting our paper again.\n",
    "### The main changes made are:\n",
    "1) Adding a new subsection in the 'Related works' section to discuss the tools maintained and comparing them with OSCAR. To show this we used a comparison table.    \n",
    "2) Two other tools have been added in the Related works: ELDA and YASGUI. (as the reviewers suggested)  \n",
    "3) Publishing a release of OSCAR via the Zenodo service. (http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2587541)  \n",

    "\n",
    "After David made his revision of the paper all the textual adjustments have been made, plus the version of OSCAR uploaded on Zenodo has been modified, so to clarify the fact that the uploaded version is the v2.0.0 of OSCAR (the one we are presenting in the current paper).  "
