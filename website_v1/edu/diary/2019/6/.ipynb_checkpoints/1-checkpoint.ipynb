    "Together with Luca we have tested the current version of DIPAM, and analysed what should be improved and further reanalysed: \n",
    "* The number of topics parameter must be something a user can insert freely, and should not be selectable from a dropdown option list.\n",
    "* As default filters we don’t need the ‘Footnotes’ option. Whether, it could be very useful to filter and removes the article header and its list of references.\n",
    "* Since the simple users don’t usually have experience on the Regular Expression rules it could be good to add an external link to guideline or a demo for it.\n",
    "* As we will move soon to the visualisation of the LDA topics, one very useful and dynamic library to use is ```pyLDAvis```. https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/topic-modeling-gensim-python/ (on the visualisation section)  "
