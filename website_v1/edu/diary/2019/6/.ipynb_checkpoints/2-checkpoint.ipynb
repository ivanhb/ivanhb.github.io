    "## The CATARSI meeting\n",
    "This was our last meeting before our conference in Lisbona. We mainly focused on installing MATAO on Windows and Mac, we have face three type of problems:\n",
    "* Regarding the python libraries: \n",
    "    * The “pdftotext” library appeared to be a tough one to install, since it require “gcc” which makes it difficult to integrate in operating system that lack the presence of “gcc”, plus installing it could take a lot of time and slow performances.  -> We have decided to move on another library which does the same job without the need of “gcc” or other major requirements.\n",
    "    * The nltk corpus, and tokeniser must be downloaded and included in the text file of the pip installations needed. This process needs a lot of time but its necessary. \n",
    "* Regarding the bash files of windows: \n",
    "    * We could not manage to execute the entire bash file, the line terminals are defined differently in windows\n",
    "* MATAO problems:\n",
    "    * The shutdown button is not working correctly\n",
    "    * Matplotlib creates many threads which make some systems stop MATAO as the number of maximum threads in memory is reached \n",
    "    * MATAO should run only with Chrome, right now it opens the default browser of the hosting system\n",
    "    * The regular expressions performances are low, this aspect need a further analysis\n",
    "    * The name MATAO looks an suitable, since it means “lazy worker” in the Portoghese language.  \n",

    "## MATAO modifications\n",
    "Taking in consideration all the problems we have faced during the CATARSI meeting, I have applied some adjustments to MATAO, the main points are:\n",
    "* Instead of “pdftotext” we will use “pdfminer” which works perfectly without the need of “gcc\"\n",
    "* The shutdown button works\n",
    "* The new name of MATAO is MITAO now: a Mashup Interface for Text Analysis Operations.\n",
    "* After running and creating the charts with “Matplotlib” all the threads created are killed \n",
    "* MITAO will redirect the user to Chrome after its initialisation \n",
    "* The regular expressions having the “DOT_ALL” flag have slow performances, I changed this behaviour into a more simple RowXRow iteration over the textual input. \n",
