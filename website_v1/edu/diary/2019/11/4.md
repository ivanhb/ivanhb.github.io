##RetractionWatch analysis: last meeting uptakes 
On the last meeting with Silvio we analysed together the results obtained last week on the first phase of this work ([https://ivanhb.github.io/phd/project/retractionanalysis/result/retractedanalysis.pdf](https://ivanhb.github.io/phd/project/retractionanalysis/result/retractedanalysis.pdf).  
Here are some important notes to take care of while moving on the next elaborations: 

* Add the “Retraction date” for each of the retracted article in the table.
* Repeat the analysis also for all the other Humanities disciplines in the Retracted-Watch database.
* “Reproducibility” and “Repeatability” are two important aspects to be aware of on this work.
* Data with a “CC-BY” license could still be used in this work. Such data should be saved separately and referred to as independent from my “CC0” dataset. E.g I can retrieve data from MAG (Microsoft Academic) and have my own copy of the dump used, but such data should be referred to as an individual dataset which have its own copyright license.
* The next important step of my Ph.D. work purpose is to build/define a methodology (maybe using prototype.io), and defining some research questions. 

##RetractionWatch analysis: phase 2
I will follow these steps for each of the (HUM) categories inside the “Retracted Watch” database:

1. Get the HTML table from the website ([http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?](http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?)) and convert it using the web tool in [https://www.becsv.com/table-csv.php](https://www.becsv.com/table-csv.php).  
**Note:** Some of the values in the CSV are repeated since the same DOI might be retracted several times, with different reasons. In this case COCI will be queried on only one DOI and all the retraction reasons will be listed in the same cell value.
2. Once I have applied this elaboration on all the Humanities categories inside “Retracted Watch” I will take in consideration the disciplines which gave me the higher/relevant results in COCI (citations number). 
3. I will select some specific DOIs, those that have enough citations in COCI, and can hopefully give me some meaningful overcomes. You can check the Python process at the same ipynb file at: [https://github.com/ivanhb/phd/blob/master/project/retraction_analysis/script/nb.ipynb](https://github.com/ivanhb/phd/blob/master/project/retraction_analysis/script/nb.ipynb).
4. I have taken in consideration as an example 2 different DOIs from two different disciplines: [10.1080/014198700329114](doi.org/10.1080/014198700329114) (History), [10.1016/j.leaqua.2011.02.002](doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.2011.02.002) (Religion). These are the next steps made:
	1. List all the COCI citations and classify them in three categories relatively to the Retraction date of the DOI analysed: (a)Before;(b)Same year;(c)After. **Note:** for all the citations I have considered only the Year from the original date. The "Same year" classification is considered since many citations don't have a complete date description (day-month-year), therefore I will consider the less restricted option: only the year value.     
	2. Once all the COCI citations are currently classified, I will go further and analyse the articles which cited the retracted article after its retraction date, and investigate two different aspects: (a) The citations context into the full text of the citing article;(b) give an interpretation/reason which answers the question: Why the retracted article has been cited ?
