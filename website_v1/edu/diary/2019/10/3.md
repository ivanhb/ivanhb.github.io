The presentation made at FORCE2019 is already on Zenodo: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3502870.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3502870)

Here I list the questions raised by the audience right after the end of my presentation:

1. Do you plan to do the COCI elaboration approach also with other sources (besides Crossref) ?
2. Why is Elsevier on the bottom of the list, do you have a plan/approach on trying to. Change that ?
3. What did you do to classify citations into “author self citations”? Are you planning to do something to disambiguate authors in the future beside using the ORCID !?
4. What are you doing with the errors found in the COCI elaboration (crossref), are you planning to re-contact crossref with a report on that ?
5. Have you tried to make a qualitative analysis by comparing the data in COCI with the results given by Scopus or GoogleScholar ?

##FORCE2019: The panel session 
All the materials related to the panel, including the slides used by the organisers have been uploaded on Zenodo:

The discussion started with a small introduction from Bianca Kramer, talking about the open citations generally and the I4OC Initiative, and where the lack of data are exactly. Then she showed several services, including OpenCitations. Each of the panel members did a small presentation about their organisation. Right after that the discussion started with the following questions:  

* **How can we cover a larger proportion of open citations data?**
* **What will all of us achieve in ideal world, where citations are all open ?**
