    "## The CATARSI tool\n",
    "We discussed the CATARSI project, until now everything which have been made look fine. We might think about adopting a new type of tool named ’Terminal’ (for the visualisation and data extraction tools): a possible solution is to visualise the current ’tool' node in a different Color.  \n",
    "I have given the tool I am developing the name **DIPAM: a Dashboard Interface for Python-based Applications Mashup**. And this is its current logo, I have designed for it:  \n",

    "#### Editing/Removing diagram elements\n",
    "it’s possible to define the attributes of each type of node (tool/data) added into the diagram, and select the attributes which could be edited. For instance, the ’tool’ nodes have currently two attributes: name, and type. Both these values are editable. This screenshot shows how this operation is accomplished from the tool interface.\n",

    "#### Compatibility adaption\n",
    "The nodes in the graph couldn’t be connected freely, since they should respect the compatible inputs of each other different node in the graph. When selecting a node: x, the graph will color the compatible nodes which could be connected with x (the output of x will become the input of the connected nodes).  The following screenshot shows what happens when selecting a node (’Textual data (d1)’) in the graph: in this case both ‘Filter names (t1)’ and ’Topic modelling (t2)’ are available nodes to be connected with, while ‘View bar chart (t3)’ is not available. In case a giving node gets modified, its adaptability view will be updated. \n",
