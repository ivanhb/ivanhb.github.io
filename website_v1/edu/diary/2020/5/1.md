##PalRead Project
Together with Marilena we arranged 2 meetings to work on the PalRead project. Th Github repository at: [https://github.com/dharc-org/palread-import-omekas](https://github.com/dharc-org/palread-import-omekas) contains all the materials related to the project. We have almost defined all the workflow pipeline and we plan to finalise the whole process in the next 2 weeks.

##The DHARC Digital Library
With Tommaso and Francesca Giovanetti we talked about the DIgital Library project status and the next processing steps. The process is close to the one we are adopting in the "PalRead" project. I will provide a script to handle all the Omeka-S operations form bash. Francesca needs to define the ontology and provide a mapping to it.

##Retraction analysis
I have fixed some small issues in the protocols.io methodology, and finalised some other minor errors. Going back to the paper, the methodology described is partial, and it includes the main parts of the methodology without mentioning any technical aspect (coding).
