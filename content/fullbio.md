# Short Biography	

I was born in Israel, my father is Arab and my mother is Italian. After my high school graduation at the age of 18, I moved to the [University of Bologna (Italy)](https://www.unibo.it/en) where I studied and completed my bachelor's and master's degrees in [Computer Science](https://corsi.unibo.it/laurea/informatica). After my graduation, I began my career as an academic researcher with my first year as a research fellow at the University of Bologna for the [OpenCitations](https://opencitations.net) project (under the supervision of prof. [Silvio Peroni](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/silvio.peroni/)).  

I hold a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science achieved at the [Department of Classical Philology and Italian Studies, University of Bologna](https://ficlit.unibo.it/it). My Ph.D. research concerned the integration of Semantic Web technologies in the Science Of Science (SoS) field of study, especially toward the Arts and Humanities domain. My focus was toward the understanding of the retraction phenomenon in the scientific publication domain through the application of a qualitative and quantitative analysis on the bibliographic and citation data. MY Ph.D. thesis in available at http://amsdottorato.unibo.it/10024/. 

I am currently a research fellow at the University of Bologna on the OpenCitations project, my responsibilities concern the management and development of the OpenCitations computational infrastructure.

Among my research interests are Semantic Web technologies, Information science, Data visualisation, automatic processes of analysis and segmentation of documents, and Science of Science. My works concern theoretical studies and technical implementation of tools to foster semantic interoperability of Open Science services and infrastructures, the empirical analysis of the nature of scholarly citations, bibliometrics and scientometrics studies, visualisation and browsing interfaces for semantic data.
