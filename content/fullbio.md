# Short Biography

I pursued and successfully obtained my bachelor's and master's degrees in [Computer Science](https://corsi.unibo.it/laurea/informatica) from the [University of Bologna (Italy)](https://www.unibo.it/en). Following my graduation, I embarked on an academic journey, commencing my initial year as a research fellow at the University of Bologna. During this period, I worked on the [OpenCitations](https://opencitations.net) project under the guidance of Professor [Silvio Peroni](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/silvio.peroni/).

I hold a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science achieved at the [Department of Classical Philology and Italian Studies, University of Bologna](https://ficlit.unibo.it/it). My Ph.D. research concerned the integration of Semantic Web technologies in the Science Of Science (SoS) field of study, especially toward the Arts and Humanities domain. My focus was toward the understanding of the retraction phenomenon in the scientific publication domain through the application of a qualitative and quantitative analysis on the bibliographic and citation data. MY Ph.D. thesis in available at http://amsdottorato.unibo.it/10024/.

I am currently holding the position of Assistant Professor at the University of Bologna, my work is primarily concerned toward  the [PE5 – CHANGES “Cultural Heritage Active Innovation for Sustainable” project](https://sites.google.com/uniroma1.it/changes/). Specifically, I am involved in the PE5 SPOKE 4 – Virtual Technologies for Museums and Art Collections. Additionally, I still hold an active role in the management and advancement of the [OpenCitations](https://opencitations.net/) computational infrastructure. OpenCitations is an independent non-profit organization dedicated to open scholarship, focusing on the publication of open bibliographic and citation data.   

Among my research interests are Semantic Web technologies, Information science, Data visualisation, automatic processes of analysis and segmentation of documents, and Science of Science. My works concern theoretical studies and technical implementation of tools to foster semantic interoperability of Open Science services and infrastructures, the empirical analysis of the nature of scholarly citations, bibliometrics and scientometrics studies, visualisation and browsing interfaces for semantic data.
